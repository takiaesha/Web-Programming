I have made this personal website using mainly Html, CSS, and Bootstrap. My website contains
four pages. They are Home, About, Hobbies and Contact.

On the home page, there is some information about my learning path. I have also added my skills
that I am currently obtaining. On the about page, there is some information about my academic
carrier. In the hobbies section, there are some hobbies of mine. Finally, on the contact page, there
is some important information to reach me out. There I added my address, phone number, email
etc.
